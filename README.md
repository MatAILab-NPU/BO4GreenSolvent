# BO4GreenSolvent

This code is about the two-step BO framework for development of TEP-based solvent for air-processed perovskite solar cells. 
The highest efficiency of the last two rounds was calibrated based on the condition combination numbered 16. In each round of the experiment, we would repeatedly prepare the perovskite film under condition 16.

Some key packages (and their versions) involved to run this code are as follows:
